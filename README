**Testing/concept only**

Very simple Nextflow resource optimizer to find reasonable upper bounds based on few samples.

Example 1:

    # If you are just working with one project
    path/to/main.py .
    nextflow run ... -c resources.config

  Example 2:

    # To combine older projects
    path/to/main.py . /path/to/nextflow/run1 /path/to/nextflow/run2
    nextflow run ... -c resources.config

This tool will attempt to use more accurate "native" executor memory/wall-time metrics if they are available. Since these are time-limited, the hidden file ".optimized_cache.json" is saved in each provided Nextflow folder.
